Speedscale: uses a special text string called a signature to differentiate between different requests. Once this
  signature is generated, it is matched against the library of signatures generated from the previously recorded
  traffic. If multiple requests have the same signature but different responses, Speedscale will cycle through
  the responses in order. Signatures are essentially hash maps of key=value pairs.
